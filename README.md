# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a rendition of a website with my own custom CSS! I got a little carried away and I think it looks decent. It was really fun to do all sorts of techniques in CSS and make the website have structure and pop.

To run this website, first clone this repository onto your machine and then navigate to where it exists in Git Bash. 
Then, to enter VSCode, run the following command:
`code .`

This will take you to the IDE which you can then open a terminal and download any packages/dependencies that the website requires.
This command is:
`npm install`

After installing all the dependencies, it is now time to run the website! With the provided "Live Preview" VSCode extension. You
can open the VSCode command terminal using the keysequence **Ctrl+Shift+P** and use the *Live Preview: Start Server* command. It is now running!
